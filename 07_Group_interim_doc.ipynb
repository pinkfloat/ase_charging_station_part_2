    "## Introduction to the Topic: ChargeHub Berlin\n",
    "\n",
    "The ChargeHub Berlin project intended us to create an interactive platform that should help residents of Berlin to locate charging stations in their area. The platform provides users with information on station availability and utilization, while also offering opportunities to contribute to the improvement of the charging infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use cases our team focused on are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Searching for available charging stations by postal code.\n",
    "2) Rating charging stations on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with the option to leave text reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the chosen use cases, a use case diagram has been created, highlighting them under \"implementation planned\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![Use Case Diagram](img/usecase_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While planning the website, we realized that the use cases alone weren’t enough to guide what we needed to implement, since many of them required a backend where users would need to log in and be individually identified. This led us to recognize that the use case diagram outlined more than just two branches, pointing to the need for additional development work.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, our final goal of the project is to provide an easily navigable website that allows users to find charging stations located in Berlin. To achieve this, we decided to build our website around a map of Berlin, where the charging stations would be visualized as markers, enabling logged in users to click on them in order to access information about the stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Map Screenshot](img/screenshot_map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our key technologies in order to create and design the website were:\n",
    "- Python (as this was a requirement)\n",
    "- HTML (also a requirement, as we were supposed to write a web application)\n",
    "    - CSS (for the design - as usual)\n",
    "- Flask and Dash (in order to programm the functionalities for the website instead of using javascript)\n",
    "- Git and Github (to store and share the progress of our project)\n",
    "    - The README file served as Task board, so outstanding tasks are currently gathered there\n",
    "    - The README was also used as cheat sheet for git commands\n",
    "- Google Firebase (as Backend / Database)\n",
    "- Whatsapp (for communication)\n",
    "- VSCode (as IDE)\n",
    "- drawio (for diagrams)"

    "\n",
    "### Domain Modeling and Event Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domain Events:  \n",
    "First draft - this needs an update as some things got named & implemented differently than planned first.\n",
    "(Vice versa, we are also planning to change some of our functions to adhere more to the DDD concept than they are now.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Domain Events](img/domain_events.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bounded contexts:  \n",
    "This also will need an update:\n",
    "The Map ended up to be static (never gets changed).  \n",
    "And the charging stations are also permanent (and only receive updates in regards of their rating and availability).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bounded Contexts](img/bounded_contexts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Screenshots of IDE project structure:\n",
    "This screenshot will be retaken once project is finalized.  \n",
    "We haven't split our code in this DDD way that was suggested as example project structure,  \n",
    "but we are going to reimplement things more domain and test driven than we did until now soon,  \n",
    "as our first approach was to find out how to create a working website at all before trying to  \n",
    "adhere to a \"how to do things\" concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "![IDE Project Structure](img/ide_project_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "We initially encountered some challenges that led us to temporarily move away from test-driven development (TDD). Test-driven development is meant to provide a concrete plan and design for a project before any actual implementation code is written. However, none of us had experience designing a web application using Python and its libraries. As a result, we had no clear understanding of how the code would come together to form a functioning web application, let alone what the parameters for the application's functions would be or how to track whether an action, like a \"button click,\" had been registered or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean, a function like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    @dash_app.callback(\n",
    "        [Output('station-details', 'children'),\n",
    "        Output('status', 'children'),\n",
    "        Output('feedback-div', 'style'),\n",
    "        Output('average-rating', 'children'),\n",
    "        Output('reviews-list', 'children')],\n",
    "        Input('station-map', 'clickData')\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    def display_station_details(dataOfClickedStation):\n",
    "```\n",
    "isn't exactly something someone who is only familiar with standard Python would intuitively understand. The use of decorators, callbacks, and the integration of Dash components is a whole different concept compared to the usual function definitions and logic flow in typical Python programming (as it is following the \"don't call us, we call you\" paradigm). It requires a different kind of thinking in terms of program logic and flow and how front-end actions, like a button click, triggers back-end functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we are currently still facing the issue how to effectively test website elements, such as buttons and other visual components, using code. Writing unit tests for functions with defined parameters and return values is relatively straightforward; you can assert that certain inputs will produce specific outputs. But testing something that only changes the state of a website—something you can only verify visually—presents a significant challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we are currently planning to rewrite big chunks of our code, split them into smaller sub-functions and implement them more test driven as we sometimes did until now, as we sometimes found ourself limited to the need to find out if code that we were planning to write might work out at all at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to ensure test coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers a package called `coverage` that allows the tracking of code coverage during the execution of unit tests. As we are planning to further decompose the functions we have implemented thus far to enhance their testability, this approach is not only expected to improve the granularity of testing, but also to increase the line coverage. We aim to achieve the test coverage of 80% at the end (excluding any HTML and CSS code that only provides design). If we fall short of this goal, we will evaluate which parts of the code might not require testing and provide a rationale for those decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Backend Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "For the backend of our project, we are utilizing Google Firebase, a platform that provides a suite of cloud-based services including a real-time NoSQL database, authentication, and hosting. Firebase serves as the foundation for storing user data and managing charging station ratings. User passwords are securely stored as hashed values, ensuring sensitive information is protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The development coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "We had a team meeting at the BHT just before Christmas, where we set up GitHub profiles for everyone and provided an extensive explanation of how to use various Git commands properly (resulting in a git cheat sheet in our website README). This meeting also marked the first planning session for the website, where we discussed its general design. We decided on a central map featuring clickable charging stations, with each click displaying information about the selected station.\n",
    "\n",
    "To organize tasks, we used the README on our GitHub page to keep track of open tasks and identified bugs. As we completed tasks, we simply removed them from the list, with all changes to the README being committed so we could maintain a record of updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we created was a simple login HTML page, which initially lacked any functionality. From there, we gradually started learning how to integrate HTML with Python and began developing the site into something more functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UI Components\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user enters the website, they are greeted by a login screen with the option to create a new user profile if they don't already have one.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Login Screen](img/screenshot_login.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The login data that is created (we’ve already created a few by manually testing everything) is stored in our Firebase database, using a combination of the username and a hashed password.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Firebase Users](img/screenshot_firebase_users.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two versions of the \"Create Profile\" page. The first one is functional and currently in use. To create a new profile, the user simply needs to choose a username and set a password. It is not possible to create a new user with a name that already exists (e.g., \"admin1\"). However, it is currently possible to create \"strange\" usernames (e.g., consisting of just one letter or number). We will implement boundary checks soon to prevent these types of entries (when we rewrite the functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create Profile 1](img/screenshot_create_profile_v1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second version of the \"Create Profile\" page was designed to demonstrate more proper data collection. However, since the functionality for the additional fields hasn’t been implemented yet, this is still an open opportunity for us to implement things in a \"test-driven\" way from the start. We are still discussing which fields to include, as our team has varying opinions on the necessity of collecting and storing so much extra data. That said, we’d like to keep the possibility open, as this could also provide the oportunity for us to increase the coverage / the amount of tested code and unit test examples, as we move forward with this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create Profile 2](img/screenshot_create_profile_v2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the user has successfully logged in, they are greeted by the main page and can click on a charging station. Hovering over a charging station will display a small summary of its information.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mainpage](img/screenshot_mainpage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a charging station is clicked, the user is provided with additional information on the right-hand side of the screen, along with the option to rate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Station Details](img/screenshot_station_details.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The status of a station and its rush hour data are currently randomized, as they are intended to simulate what real data might look like. All other information is gathered from our data source, except for the ratings, which are pulled from our Firebase database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the user has the option to search for charging stations by postal code. We decided it would make sense to zoom into the area corresponding to the postal code in response to a search, allowing the user to easily select a charging station within that area from the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Zipcode Search](img/screenshot_zipcode_search.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our main tasks before the presentation are to rewrite and polish our code in a domain driven and test driven way by breaking it down into smaller, more easily testable chunks assigned to a domain, aiming for 80% unit test coverage, and implementing an extended \"Create Profile\" page after creating tests for its planned features. We also need to set boundaries for user profile creation, particularly for validating usernames and passwords (now that we’ve confirmed the core functionality is working), as well as establishing limits for the number of symbols allowed in charging station commentaries. Additionally, we may want to refine some aspects of the web interface, such as displaying the username of the person who submitted a rating, and address any remaining bugs (if they are still there after refactoring). We also still need to create flowcharts for our use case functions and update our domain event flow and project structure. And we still ain't sure if we are supposed to implement a CI/CD pipeline when half of our group just learns how to use git without any further requirements by doing so."

    "### Integration of explored datasets from the first part of the module\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project’s \"tools\" subfolder, you’ll find an additional Python script called `createChargingStationDatabase.py`. This script is considered a tool because it isn't directly connected to our website, but it’s used to generate the `ChargingStationData.csv` file in our data folder from the two datasets, `geodata_berlin_plz.csv` and `Ladesaeulenregister_SEP.xlsx`, which were explored in the first part of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that we didn’t copy anything directly from the first project, aside from these two datasets; everything else was created from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting `ChargingStationData.csv` contains renamed columns from the charging station register, as we needed to translate the feature names from German to English (and commas to dotts). It also merges data from both sources, appending geodata based on zip codes to each charging station. Additionally, we only kept data for charging stations located in Berlin, as other locations weren't needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach to cleaning the data and creating a new CSV file was more focused on the data itself than on how it would work within the system by following a DDD concept. This is because, when we were cleaning the data already a couple of weeks ago, we didn’t realize that the restructurization of its contents were supposed to be part of applying a Domain-Driven Design and simply considered the newly created and combined csv file \"a cleaner data source that we can use\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM-Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "We weren’t initially aware that using large language models was part of the project, so this requirement came as a bit of a surprise. Naturally, since ChatGPT has become somewhat like the new Google, we started by asking it various questions, including basic ones about how to get code running with Flask and how to set up a simple \"Hello World\" example. Additionally, since English isn’t the first language for any of us, we’ve been using ChatGPT to help improve the wording and clarity of this documentation. In other words, I’d write something, then ask ChatGPT to revise it. I’d then decide which parts sounded better if they were written more natural and which ones needed further enhancement. We also used a LLM to generate the images for the background of our Login and Profile Creation pages.\n",

    "3) Getting the project components—Database, Website, and Python programming—to work together [Solved through a trial-and-error approach]\n",
